    "## What You're Aiming For\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create a class called \"Account\" that has the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- account_number (string)\n",
    "- account_balance (float)\n",
    "- account_holder (string)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The class should have the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- deposit(amount: float) - This method should add the amount passed as an argument to the account balance.\n",
    "- withdraw(amount: float) - This method should subtract the amount passed as an argument from the account balance, but only if the account balance is greater than the amount being withdrawn.\n",
    "- check_balance() - This method should return the current account balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a new file called \"bank_account.py\"\n",
    "- Define the Account class and its attributes as specified above.\n",
    "- Define the deposit() method. It should take in one argument, the amount to be deposited, and add it to the account balance.\n",
    "- Define the withdraw() method. It should take in one argument, the amount to be withdrawn, and subtract it from the account balance.\n",
    "- The method should only execute the withdrawal if the account balance is greater than or equal to the amount to be withdrawn.\n",
    "- Define the check_balance() method. It should return the current account balance.\n",
    "- Create an instance of the Account class, and assign it to a variable called \"my_account\".\n",
    "- Use the methods of the class to deposit and withdraw money from the account, and check the account balance.\n",
    "- Test the program by creating multiple instances of the class and performing different transactions on them."
